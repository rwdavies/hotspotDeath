A first look at the PacBio 3D7 data
===================================







We prepared roughly 15ug of DNA from the canonical Plasmodium falciparum strain, 3D7, for sequencing on Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's PacBio RS-II instrument.  This was sequenced on eight SMRT cells, which should yield approximately 100x coverage over the 23 megabase genome.  Having just received the filtered subreads (in unaligned and aligned form), we investigated some very basic properties of the data.
